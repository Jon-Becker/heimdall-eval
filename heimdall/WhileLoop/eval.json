{
  "score": 5,
  "summary": "The decompiled version fundamentally fails to capture the original functionality. It has inverted loop logic, incorrect control flow, and would not execute the intended loop behavior.",
  "differences": [
    "Loop condition is inverted: uses 'if (!0 < arg0)' instead of 'while (i < loops)'",
    "Missing loop counter variable 'i' entirely",
    "Loop body does not increment any counter, causing infinite loop or no execution",
    "Logic is wrapped in a broken if-statement instead of proper while loop",
    "Inner while loop condition '!0 > 0x01' is a tautology that will never execute",
    "Require statement 'require(!number > (number + 0x01))' is logically invalid and will always fail",
    "Function signature changed from non-payable to payable",
    "Original function increments 'number' exactly 'loops' times; decompiled version will either fail or not increment at all",
    "Missing proper loop termination condition based on the input parameter",
    "License changed from UNLICENSED to MIT"
