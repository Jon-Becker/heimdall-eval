{
  "score": 5,
  "summary": "The decompiled version is fundamentally broken and does not capture the original functionality. It has incorrect function signature, logic, and semantics.",
  "differences": [
    "Function signature changed from 'public' to 'public view' - viewing state instead of modifying it",
    "Loop logic completely missing - no while loop or iteration present",
    "State modification removed - 'number = number + 1' is absent",
    "Nonsensical require statements that don't match original logic",
    "Undefined variables 'var_a' and 'var_b' introduced with magic numbers",
    "Parameter name changed from 'loops' to 'arg0'",
    "Function no longer increments the 'number' state variable",
    "The require(arg0 == arg0) statement is always true and meaningless",
    "The require(!0 < arg0) statement contradicts the loop condition check",
    "Missing the incrementing loop counter logic",
    "Output would fail to compile due to undefined variable references"
