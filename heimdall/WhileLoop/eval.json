  "score": 95,
  "summary": "The decompiled version accurately captures the original functionality. The while loop is converted to an equivalent for loop, variable names are simplified (loops → arg0), and numeric operations are expressed in hex notation (1 → 0x01). The core logic of incrementing a counter and looping is preserved. Minor differences include function visibility modifiers (payable added) and the contract name change, which do not affect functional behavior.",
