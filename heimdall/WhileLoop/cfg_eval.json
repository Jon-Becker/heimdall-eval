  "summary": "CFG captures the main while loop structure with entry, loop body, and exit. The loop back-edge from the increment operation to the condition check is missing, and overflow checking path is present but missing the successful continuation after addition.",
  "missing_paths": [
    "Loop back-edge: After incrementing i (i = i + 1), control should return to the loop condition check (i < loops) at block 7",
    "Successful overflow check continuation: Block 8 should have an edge to a block that stores the result and continues the loop, but this path is not shown"

  "observations": [
    "Block 0-2: Contract deployment with CALLVALUE check (revert if ETH sent) - correct",

    "Block 4-5: Parameter decoding for loop function with input validation - correct",
    "Block 7: Loop condition check (i < loops) with branch to block 8 (loop body) or block 10 (exit) - correct structure",
    "Block 8: Loop body performs number + 1 with SafeMath overflow check, calls helper at 0x0166",
    "Block 9: Overflow revert path with Panic(0x11) - arithmetic overflow error - correct",
    "Block 10: Loop exit leading to STOP - correct",
    "Block 8 shows the addition operation but CFG is missing the back-edge to block 7 for loop continuation",
    "The increment of i (i = i + 1) appears to be inlined in the bytecode but the graph does not show the complete cycle back to condition",
    "Block 13: Getter function for 'number' state variable - correct implementation",
