  "summary": "The CFG accurately represents the while loop control flow with proper loop entry, body execution, condition checking, and exit paths. The loop structure is correctly implemented with overflow protection.",

  "extra_paths": [
    "Overflow revert path in addition operations (compiler-generated safety checks not in source)"
  ],
  "observations": [
    "Node 7 correctly implements the while loop condition check (i < loops) with ISZERO and conditional jump",
    "Node 8 contains the loop body: incrementing number (SLOAD, ADD, SSTORE) and i",
    "Node 11 is the loop exit point reached when condition fails (i >= loops)",
    "Nodes 9 and 10 contain overflow checking for addition operations - these are Solidity 0.8+ automatic safety checks",
    "The CFG shows proper back-edge from loop body (node 8/10) returning to condition check (node 7)",
    "Function dispatcher correctly routes to loop() function (selector 0x0b7d796e) and number() getter (selector 0x8381f58a)",
    "Callvalue check (node 0->1) ensures no ETH is sent to non-payable function",
    "Parameter validation in nodes 4-6 and 12 handles malformed calldata",
    "The while loop semantic (check-then-execute) is correctly represented in the CFG structure"
