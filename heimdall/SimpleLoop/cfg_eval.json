  "score": 85,
  "summary": "The CFG captures the main control flow of the SimpleLoop contract including the for-loop structure, but has some structural differences due to EVM compilation optimizations and lacks explicit back-edge representation for the loop iteration.",
  "missing_paths": [
    "Explicit loop back-edge from increment (i++) back to condition check (i < loops)",
    "Loop increment block (i++) as separate node before jumping back to condition"
  ],
  "extra_paths": [
    "Overflow check path (node 9) for number++ increment - Panic(0x11) revert on arithmetic overflow",
    "Input validation revert path (node 6) for calldata parameter validation",
    "Generic calldata size check revert (node 11)",
    "Fallback/invalid selector revert (node 14)"
  ],
  "observations": [
    "The for-loop is represented with condition check at node 7 (LT, ISZERO pattern) and body at node 8",
    "Node 7 contains the loop condition (i < loops) with ISZERO to invert for conditional jump",
    "Node 8 contains the loop body (number++) with SLOAD/SSTORE pattern",
    "The loop back-edge is implicit - after node 8's arithmetic operations, control returns to node 7 via the missing increment path",
    "Node 9 represents Solidity 0.8.x's built-in overflow protection for the number++ operation",
    "The CFG correctly shows two function selectors: 0x0b7d796e (loop) and 0x8381f58a (number getter)",
    "Node 10 represents the loop exit path when condition (i < loops) is false",
    "The increment operation for loop counter i is embedded within the arithmetic overflow check flow rather than shown as separate node",
    "Contract deployment checks (CALLVALUE check) are correctly represented in nodes 0-1"
