  "score": 15,
  "summary": "The decompiled version has critical logic errors. The loop condition is inverted and semantically broken, making the function unable to execute the intended loop. The control flow is fundamentally incorrect.",
  "differences": [
    "Loop condition `!0 < arg0` is logically malformed and will not execute the intended for loop",
    "Missing proper initialization of loop counter `i`",
    "Loop increment `number = number + 0x01` is present but unreachable due to inverted condition",
    "Spurious second while loop with nonsensical condition `(number - 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)` that serves no purpose",
    "Function marked as `payable` when original is not",
    "Original's simple `number++` in straightforward for loop replaced with convoluted and broken control flow",
    "The decompiled version will not increment `number` as intended, completely failing the original functionality"
