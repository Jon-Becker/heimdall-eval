{
  "score": 5,
  "summary": "The decompiled version is fundamentally broken and does not capture the original functionality. It has the wrong function signature (view instead of non-view), meaningless require statements, incomplete logic, and undefined variables.",
  "differences": [
    "Function signature is incorrect: decompiled uses 'public view' instead of 'public', making it read-only when original modifies state",
    "Loop logic is completely missing: original has for loop that increments number, decompiled has no loop",
    "Invalid require statements: 'require(arg0 == arg0)' is always true and serves no purpose",
    "Invalid require statement: 'require(!0 < arg0)' is invalid syntax (cannot use ! operator on integer comparison)",
    "Invalid require statement with overflow logic: 'require(number - 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)' is nonsensical",
    "Undefined variables: var_a and var_b are assigned but never used and not declared",
    "Missing state mutation: original increments the 'number' state variable, decompiled does not",
    "License changed from UNLICENSED to MIT",
    "Contract name changed from SimpleLoop to DecompiledContract",
    "No actual loop implementation present in decompiled version"
