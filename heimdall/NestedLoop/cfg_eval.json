  "score": 72,
  "summary": "CFG captures the nested loop structure but is missing the back edges for both loop iterations and has incomplete inner loop exit path representation",
  "missing_paths": [
    "Back edge from inner loop body (node 9) to inner loop condition check (node 8) for j++",
    "Back edge from inner loop exit to outer loop increment and condition check (node 7) for i++",

    "Node 9 -> Node 10 appears as unconditional but should be conditional on overflow check",

  "observations": [
    "The outer loop initialization (i=0) and condition check (i < loops) are correctly represented at node 7 (0x77-0x7f)",
    "The inner loop initialization (j=0) at node 8 (0x80-0x8c) is correct",
    "The inner loop body with number += 1 and overflow check is at node 9",
    "Node 10 represents the arithmetic overflow panic (0x4e487b71 selector with error code 0x11)",
    "Node 11 represents loop exit and function return via STOP",
    "Missing explicit back edges make the CFG appear acyclic when the actual control flow has two nested cycles",
    "The overflow check path (node 9 -> 10) correctly captures Solidity 0.8+ checked arithmetic",
    "Function selector dispatch (nodes 3, 13) correctly handles loop() and number() selectors",
    "The CFG correctly shows the revert paths for invalid callvalue (node 1), invalid selector (node 15), and invalid calldata (node 12)"
