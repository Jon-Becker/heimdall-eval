  "score": 5,
  "summary": "The decompiled version is fundamentally broken and does not capture the original functionality. It's marked as view when it should be non-view, lacks the nested loop logic entirely, contains nonsensical require statements, and attempts to assign to undefined variables.",
  "differences": [
    "Function visibility: Original is 'public', decompiled is 'public view' - the state modification means it cannot be view",
    "Loop logic completely missing: Original has nested for loops incrementing a counter loops² times, decompiled has no loops at all",
    "State mutation removed: Original increments 'number' state variable, decompiled does not modify state",
    "Nonsensical require statements: Decompiled contains 'require(arg0 == arg0)', 'require(!0 < arg0)' twice, and 'require(!number > (number + 0x01))' which are all either tautologies or incorrect logic",
    "Undefined variable assignments: Decompiled tries to assign to 'var_a' and 'var_b' which are never declared",
    "Missing function parameter usage: Original uses the 'loops' parameter for loop bounds, decompiled receives 'arg0' but never uses it correctly",
    "License mismatch: Original is UNLICENSED, decompiled is MIT",
    "Pragma version difference: Original specifies ^0.8.13, decompiled uses >=0.8.0"
