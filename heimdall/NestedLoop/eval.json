  "differences": [
    "License changed from UNLICENSED to MIT",
    "Contract name changed from NestedLoop to DecompiledContract",
    "Function visibility remains public but marked as payable in decompiled version (adds unnecessary capability)",
    "Variable increments expressed as 'number + 0x01' instead of 'number += 1' (functionally equivalent)",
    "Added decompilation metadata comments and documentation",
    "Pragma version range differs (^0.8.13 vs >=0.8.0)"
