Analyze the control flow graph (CFG) extracted from EVM bytecode against the original Solidity source. Identify any missing paths, unreachable code, or control flow discrepancies. Respond with raw JSON only, no markdown formatting or code fences. Format: {"score": <0-100>, "summary": "<brief summary>", "missing_paths": ["<path 1>", ...], "extra_paths": ["<path 1>", ...], "observations": ["<observation 1>", ...]}
