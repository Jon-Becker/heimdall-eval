Compare these two Solidity files and evaluate how well the decompiled version captures the original's functionality. 

Respond with raw JSON only, no markdown formatting or code fences. Format: {"score": <0-100>, "summary": "<brief summary>", "differences": ["<difference 1>", "<difference 2>", ...]}

Note: Focus on functional equivalence. Variable names, comments, licensing information, and formatting differences should not impact the score significantly unless they affect understanding of the code's purpose or behavior.

The decompiled code does not need to be valid solidity, but it should accurately represent the logic and structure of the original code.
